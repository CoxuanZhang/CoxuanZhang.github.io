# Not to Chase the Perfect Explainability

*Writen in January 2026*

> It only occurs to me at every new year countdown that we circled the sun once again. The grandest motion in the life of non-astronauts, in terms of cosmic scale. 

I flew from London back to Shanghai, from one home-like place to another. Waking up dizzy on melatonin at 1am, I expected the rare sunshine in a normal West London afternoon, instead I'm in a dark room where I grew up. My lockscreen said *Jan. 1, 2026*. There wasn't any seismic effect. With my quiet suburban neighborhood, I tried to go back to sleep.

Maybe this strong performative desire to be an adult that I recently picked up has distracted me from noticing the passing of dates. Or maybe I excused myself for the carelessness while waiting for this belated annual reflection to be done. I had many fortunes in 2025. Sprung from one spiral to another, retreating to the internals and metaphysics as life hustles by, I made many attempts to break the tiring circular narrative of living. 

And for the 2025 me, explainability is the thought that let me off the ring.

## What is Explainability?
This August, I started counseling, and quite quickly found the right person after 4-5 short calls. There became this one hour every week where I explain to her my behaviors, memories, and thoughts on life. This shaped and shattered many paradigms I use, testing the boundaries of what is explainable for / in me.

*Explainability* is so different from *understanding* because I want to emphasise the process of **abstraction**. Not only is an explanation a communication with certain others, it's a way to craft a mental model that's readily employable (for me). It doesn't have to occur through words, but solely represent the process of finding **the clearest and most precise compression for a set of multi-dimensional information**. This gave rise to several intuitions on "explainability".

1. **It is human-centered.** The statement that *'information A can be explained as information B'* is completely meaningless. If there exists a social convention such as translation where A is matched with B, then the conversion between the two no longer concerns "explainability" due to the lack of abstraction in the process. Without the sender and receiver, there is no **definite and stable** explainability between information A and B due to the nature of abstraction. I think, for example, the multi-sensory experience of walking a dimly-lit alley at night is best expressed through "walking from a moon to another under water" from Wang Xiaobo's novella [Green-haired Sea Monster](https://goodreads.com/book/show/56529670-9), but we can definitely agree to disagree.

1. **It is reflective.** A matter can be explained by me is equivalent to its property of being explainable to me. Both statements require the same set of keys to open my brain. 

Therefore, if we attempt to formalise explainability as a predicate, P_ab

## Why does Explainability Concern Ethics?

As I interpret my dialogues with my therapist, I find a constant subtext, whether something is explainable concerns a moral standard for me. I recognise explainability can overlap with Grice's [Cooperation Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle), which everyone normally abides to in conversation. However, there's a moral urgency I see in crafting explainability, to combat the flat banality of language. 

Language as a form of compression inevitably encounters the loss of information. The term "lost in translation" is used often but the issue of "explainability" concerns the loss of information from an individual perception (whether an experience or a thought) to words.

If we take "abuse" as a systematic squandering of individuals, then language is inherently abusive. It flatly discriminates all its users and nonusers regardless of whether we are aware of it. This case seems more prominent in the second language but is present even in our first language. Natural language, by nature, is a futile and ineffective tool when it comes to projecting individual thoughts externally.

Thus, my moral belief in explainability is to not be squandered and to rebel. Language is the gateway that connect us as individuals to the world and its network of people. We must take hold of the language coming out of our mouth to testify integrity of its representation and construction of truth. 

This case for the morality of explainable language is especially important to me in the age of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs to me has been a tool to surpass the hefty moral concern of explainability. My primary use case for it is for emailing, especially those difficult emails. When I need to accomodate to a certain hierarchy, raise a controversial fact, or voice a difficult rejection, LLMs does the heavylifting of emotional burden for me. Throwing some rough context into the chat for it to come out in a generative soup of polite and likely conventions.

We are being stripped off the moral responsibility we hold to our speech. 

## To Speak without Formula

That's why this year I call for a priority of speaking and giving trust to the flow of natural language instead of crafting the perfect formula for explainability. This might come of contradictory to how I went off three sections on several intuitions and moral gravity of explainability. 

However, for those who takes on the moral responsibility for their own explainability, to be silenced or self-silenced is a painful comfort. With not creating anything at all, we're freed from the burden of creating faux words and images. Our personal reward system may be steering us towards this local minima, to become numb and avoidant. Of course, there's many who don't care about explainability as a philosophical / moral topic all together who probably won't make their way to this writing.

So this year, I'd like to strive a little more to speak. To put things out there, and come back to rebuild them at inspirations.

The following is my wishlist for the new year:

- [x] Make a personal website / archive
- [ ] Leave time for self-expression
- [ ] Freestyle
