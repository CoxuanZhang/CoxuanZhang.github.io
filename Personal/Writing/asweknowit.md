# As We Know It: Cutting the Cord

*Last Edited: April, 2024\
Written for Stage Performance at UWC Atlantic College\
The script was designed as a monologue later adapted with theatrical elements. This edition mixes both styles. It was brought to life with the help of my friends:*

| Name      | Role | How did it happen:|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| *Achilles*      | **My father**       | Achilles and I were running a murder mystery project week together.
| *Alice*   | **Alice (in the Wonderland)**        | Alice and I are roommates and we found her name the perfect metaphor.

>Upstage right: Coco will sit on a chair covered in red\
Downstage left: Achilles sits on a wood chair in a black suit

*Alice walks up from the first row of the audience in a  dim focus light*

*Coco*: Welcome to the wonderland that Alice was in. I’m Humpty Dumpty, here with me is…

*Alice*: My name is Alice, but–– 

*Coco (interrupted impatiently)*: It’s a stupid name! What does it mean?

*Alice*: Must a name mean something?

*Coco (scornful)*: Of course! My name means the shape I am–and a good handsome shape it is too. When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean–neither more nor less.

*Alice slowly walks offstage.*

Most of the time here, I am Coco. Still, there is another slice of me called 张珂璇 (Zhang Kexuan). \
It means a plain jade, not so good or handsome as Humpty Dumpty. Now familiarize yourself with these three characters. Stare into them. Try to pronounce them. (slowly) Zhang Kexuan. Imagine a person with such a name.

Named to be a plain jade, Zhang Kexuan’s mind was as humble, even less polished. She used to talk about authoritarianism in her family and the many tyrants she knew - she doesn’t mean it literally. But here to understand her arbitrary usages of these beep words. We have to turn the pages to “once upon a Chinese New Year”.

*Coco sits down on the chair. Lights off. Achilles walks in and sits facing backstage.*

*Coco*: Family gathering during Chinese New Year almost dilutes the family love into thin ancient lineages. All the tyrants converge and the rest of us are chained to this patriarchal extended family, carefully scrutinizing what’s true about us. 

*Coco (excited)*: You wouldn’t guess the percentage of queer-identifying students in our school! *(speaking over conversations in the background)* I’m so proud of my friend for being out and about. Actually, I..

*White Focus lights open both Achi and coco.*
The word “queer” strikes a deafening silence in the room. My father and I were sitting opposite each other. In this silence, the hippies of the sexual liberation movement and the HIV pandemic in the 1980s hysterically erupted in my father’s mind. In this confrontation, a thousand activist banners floated over my mind.

*Achilles and Coco (facing each other)*: Same sex intercourse contributed to 12% of the total HIV cases!

*Father (agitated)*: What about our roots? The same village that delivered some of the greatest Confucian teachings. (pause and stand up) What about you? Are you safe? I can drop you out of school now if this is what they‘re doing.

*Coco (stand up, facing the audience)*: I froze. I could almost see my test papers torn again, feel the shivers climbing up my spine when I was locked in the balcony, and the slap from years ago burning through my cheeks. In “verdict”, Kafka’s protagonist threw himself into the river after his father sentenced him to "death by drowning". Am I safe? Is fatherhood the smallest unit of authoritarianism?

*Both stand up.*

*Achilles*: The summer of becoming the first university student from our village, I felt thrown into the concrete jungle of Beijing. Leaving the cycle of poverty behind is a betrayal to my family but opened my freedom to adulthood.
 
*Coco*: At the finale of adolescence, I found myself drawn to a life reproached by thousands of years of ancestral teaching. An escapism that chains me even more.

*Achilles*: Never had a clock at home. The hasty metropolitan schedules chased me into a material world that constantly undermines me.

*Coco*: Never taught self acceptance. I froze in the chilling gazes of local teenagers shouting ‘Covid Bastard’ or ‘faggot’ or ‘chink’ in an alien language.

*Achilles*: We share the same sky. Years apart, still bloody azure.

*FaAchillesther and Coco*: we haven't talked for so long. 

*Both look at each other.*

*Coco*: The only night you were drunk was the only time I heard an apology from you. Are we as petty, as weak in our mistakes? For most nights, I only dare to clench my fist in front of your door or lock everyone out of my room.

*Achilles*: I don’t believe in apologies.

*Coco*: I don’t either, but I believe in growing into forgiveness.

*Under the dim lighting*

*Achilles and Coco*: We were trialed in this world, accused ourselves, and are yet to cure our scars.

*Father*: Only when we stand together, we are safe.

*Coco cuts off the red thread tied to Achilles*

*Coco*:  I want to cut our umbilical cord to our pasts and childhoods. Now that I inevitably became a sympathizer of this painful tie between our generations, I wish that we can one day be free together.

*Focus white light.\
Coco holds up red strings in both hands. Achilles exits stage.*

*Coco*: In a world of manhood, fatherhood, queerness, and daughterhood, why is it so hard to place a single word on identity? Maybe we’re all victims skillful at playing victims, naturally minimizing the struggle of others. This denial and politicization of identity choked me from theorizing, rationalizing, or even delivering this monologue. To unwrap our names to any audience, we bore a perpetual burden to prove our authenticity that ——
Yes, we are caring for living breathing people.

*Coco*: Is it too obscure? Or too abstract? Good, because it’s **Zhang Kexuan’s** story. She’s a humpty dumpty in her wonderland and you are all Alices. 

*Soft Yellow light in the front stage\
Alice and Achi on the two sides of the stage. Physical theater.*
