# Who built the pandemic?

**There was a time when word went around about who created the virus.** Some more politically-minded people blamed evil scientists working day and night. Some less creative pondered who nibbled at the first bat. Countries and narratives jousted about one another. Now, even these fistfights seem to be forgotten.

### That’s why I want to start with a chronology of COVID-19:

* **December 8th, 2019**. The first case of COVID-19 was found in Wuhan, China. Whether that’s the index case still remains a mystery today.

    The Ministry of Truth said, “For the unknown pneumonia pandemic that emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, reports have to be conducted based on information from the authorities. Journalists shouldn’t spread any presumption or misinformation.” 
    
    In the next month, conferences, banquets, and celebrations flourished in the city of Wuhan — Chinese New Year was approaching. Brilliant fireworks and lively revelry disguised the chaos that was to come.

* **January 20th, 2020**. The lurking epidemic broke out in the public media. The blindfolds and disguises didn’t make it through Chinese New Year with snowballing reports of the pandemic and surging diagnoses.

    I was evacuated home from a phoneless winter camp. Bags of masks were stuffed into our arms when we went home. To the younger me, the idea of the world pausing for a pandemic sounded like a surreal adventure. The Shanghai streets were so empty as if the city only harbored silhouettes of people lurking behind windows. Mom’s pink skiing goggles no longer seemed so hilarious when she put it on every time she left the house. 

* **January 28th, 2020**. The WTO declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a high-risk global emergency.

    The unreal episode of self-isolation became an indefinitely lasting state of reality. Under the iron curtain of “zero-COVID policy,” countless lockdowns of different scales spread through China. The great zero-COVID policy was greater than the Great Firewall, restructuring every aspect of our society. In a few decades, the social constructs under this policy will become a transient fantasy or another decameron. 
    
### Here goes a little dictionary of these COVID phenomena for mankind of future centuries:

* **Daily COVID test**: Self-explanatory tests. 

    Everyone must be checked for COVID-19 once a day if not more. These tests vary in form, ranging from antigen self-testing (poking a stick into your own throats or nostrils), to mobile stations (a makeshift trolley loading doctors and equipment into your front yard).

* **Travel code**: A code drawn from a precise location tracking system. 

    The travel code must always be ready for check-ups. It’s for entering your neighborhood, the hospital, everywhere. A more detailed location timeline of the infected will be updated by public health officials. 

* **Health QR code detector**: Machines everywhere scanning health QR codes. 

    The only ones who can enter venues are those who tested negative in the past 24 hours and isolated from anyone infected, the close contacts of the infected, and sometimes even the close contacts of the close contacts.

* **Baymax**: A metonymy for medical workers wrapped up in white protective suits. 

    They became heroes just like the Disney superhero robot, Baymax. This cute nickname was controversial for its potentially dehumanizing nature.

* **Sheep**: Referring to COVID positive patients because “disease-positive” and “sheep” share the same pronunciation in Mandarin. It’s usually derogatory – connected with the taboo and stigma of COVID infectants. We’re all sheep, scapegoats, and a lost herd.

> All of these entries in our mini-dictionary existed under one context – to “demolish the virus at all costs”. What did it cost us to put the zero-COVID policy on a pedestal? 

* A housekeeping lady jumped from the window of a college bathroom, her only home during lockdown. She left her few personal belongings by the staircase, shoes mended and re-mended, clothes folded in a small pile, and a Samsung with a broken screen. 

* An infected girl was humiliated for partying in clubs as her tracking history was revealed.

* Calls to the COVID suicide protection hotline that never went through due to “maintenance during the pandemic”.

We were trapped without being trapped. The COVID culture rose when the mobility and intimacy in society was torn apart. The countless waves of lockdowns spreading from city to city only seemed to extend indefinitely, which included the Shanghai lockdown I happened to be in. 

### The Spring of Shanghai
**From March 1st to June 1st, 2022**, the entirety of Shanghai was under lockdown. Hopelessly waiting, endlessly hoping, Shanghai people are cornered to the limits of our apartments and houses. I felt safe—safe from the virus we were so hurriedly pushed to quarantine against. We were so safe when there was so much we didn’t know: not the exact death toll, not the reason why some of us were escorted into the quarantine centers, not the ways to get out. We especially didn't know when this was ending. The safety in our five square meter rooms casted a veil of ignorance.

A video titled *“The Spring of Shanghai”* compiled shots of empty streets during the Shanghai pandemic. Though played forward, backward, flipped in different directions, and sent in different formats, all copies vanished into the abyss of censorship.

However, we did hear the voice crying from right beside us. Ambulances didn’t come to bring non-COVID infectants to hospitals. Families collapsed when the economy crashed. Dr. Li Wenliang, the avant-garde, passed shortly after revealing COVID under media control and continued to live in the sorrowful hearts of millions living under COVID in China. The comment section of his blog account became a wailing wall of tears. 

Demolished were the people who despised the COVID culture  in our society. Did the greater good really cost us our lives, our pursuits, our bare imagination of stepping out of our doors? Even walking down the apartment building to take the daily COVID test became a vacation. 

>When individual trust for the public and public trust of the government both failed, we hallucinated nationalism and drowned ourselves in mindless consumption.

### The Fire of Urumqi

**No one expected the suppression to burst out in a fire.**

**November 25th, 2022**, ten months into Urumqi’s full-scale lockdown. An apartment in a highrise building in Urumqi caught on fire. Whether it was because of bars and tapes over doors and gates, the delayed response of the ambulance, or unspoken ethnic tension, the first call of public dissent started. Protests were organized and spread across the country. 

1. First, there were protests and demonstrations and arrests and pre-emptive measures and pre-emptive pre-emptive arrests. 

1. Then came an odd article. The full length of it repeats the words “nice,” “marvelous,” “fabulous,” “good,” and “amazing” sarcastically paying tribute to the propaganda-censorship we all lived under. These words of satirical self-deprecation were again banned.

1. Then an idea clicked. The fire of white burning across the world. 
Who invented the color white? A passionate white. A white sheet of paper. White as protective suits. White as the void of words. White as saying all that we shall say but will be censored. Under the hashtag #A4revolution, thousands, then millions, then billions of white papers were held up in the land of China and her diaspora.

    >I’m holding a blank piece of paper.\
    They say I’m holding a gun.\
    I’m standing at the campus square.\
    They say I come from overseas.\
    I’m just an insignificant ordinary person.\
    They say I’m a big counterrevolutionary.\
    I am holding a blank piece of paper.\
    Every piece of paper has its right to remain blank.

**Overnight, the great zero-COVID policy is gone as if it had never existed.** COVID was a sneeze, nothing different from the flu. The makers of these policies claimed another great victory. 

But under the fresh sobriety coming out of this pandemic, I don’t want to hail this as a victory. The isolation, the death toll, the suspicion still lingers. I still know nothing. Without the power to write anything on this sheet of white paper, I’m still living in the pandemic that the people and the nation together conceived. As the #A4revolution marks its anniversaries, our world advances and forgets. The repercussions of COVID, however, became an undeniable part of my identity, even the collective memory of many Chinese youth.
